# Chat With PDF

Upload your document, and our chatbot will answer questions, summarize content, and answer all your Qs. Ideal for everyone, Chat with PDF turns static documents into dynamic conversations enhancing productivity 10x fold effortlessly.

This project is built using TypeScript, React, Next.js, Styled-components, OpenAI, Clerk, Stripe, and Firebase. It was initially inspired by an online coding challenge, but I have modified and expanded upon it using different technologies to enhance its functionality and design.
